# LSTM-Based Daytrader Agent

The notebook in this repo creates an LSTM-based daytrader agent. This project was developed in the context of the "Finance and Structuring for DS" class at Columbia University.

The constraints that had to be respected in this project, were:
- The agent can only buy at open and keep the position open untill close, or sell already before close.
- Only historical financial data was allowed to train the model.
